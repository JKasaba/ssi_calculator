# ssi_calculator - Academy Spectral Similarity Index Calculator

The app is currently deployed on a (open source) Shiny Server on a DigitalOcean machine at http://165.227.11.103/

The actual code for the app lives at `/srv/shiny-server/ssi_calculator/`. That folder is a clone of this git repo, so to update the application you can do a `git pull` from within that folder. Note that if you manually modify files in that folder and then try to do a `git pull`, you will likely run into merge conflicts, so it's a good idea to only pull from that serer and not develop on it.
